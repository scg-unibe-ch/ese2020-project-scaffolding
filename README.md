# ese2020-project-scaffolding

## About
This project contains an Angular frontend and an NodeJs backend wich uses Express as a framework. The website displays todolists which can be customized with items to complete. Every list and item is saved in a database, meaning they will still be available after you restart the website or thet backend. 

## Prerequisite
First of all you have to install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/de/download/), which comes per default with the packet manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
To verify the installation worked, type `npm -v` and `node -v` in your favourite command line interface (cli). If a version number appears and no error message appears the installation was successful.

## Start
To clone the repository you can either download it as a zip folder (recommended) or clone it and delete the .git folder. Then you can follow the README in the frontend folder and backend folder respectively.

## General Information

You should take the rest of the structure as a guide but you may also use your own folder structure.
